Hello!  
This is a little work in progress project I'm doing to fine tune some subtleties in the PivotalWeather UI. 
Don't get me wrong, I love PW... but there's a couple things that eat up time and can be annoying. 


Features: 
1. Remove the "hover links" above the slider, so you don't accidently mouse over and jump away from the spot you want
2. Change the slider behavior so when you let go, it loses focus. Currently the slider "button" stays in focus and when you use arrows or scroll on the page, the slider will move. Workaround, you have to click away from the slider each time.  This feature removes the workaround.
3. Removable of some models I never use 

   
Ideas for future development:
-options page (started) to configure which features you want on/off
-(idea) default page load to a certain model or Animation(e.g. Forecast Loop) <-- this can be accomplished today by bookmarking fh=loop in the querystring. Example: https://www.pivotalweather.com/model.php?m=ecmwf_full&fh=loop&pwplus=1

If you have any questions or ideas, send them my way: eric@mnchaser.com
