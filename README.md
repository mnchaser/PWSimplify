Hello!  
This is a little work in progress project I'm using to fine tune some subtleties in the PivotalWeather UI.  

### RELEASE NOTES v1.2
NEW FEATURES
1. Favorites!

BUG FIXES
- none

MAJOR FEATURES 
1. Remove the Step Time "hover links" above the slider, so you don't accidently mouse over and jump away from the spot you want
2. Change the slider behavior so when you let go, it loses focus. Currently the slider "button" stays in focus and when you use arrows or scroll on the page, the slider will move. Workaround, you have to click away from the slider each time.  This feature removes the workaround.
3. Choose which Models show in the Menu (can speed up hiding menu if you accidentally hover over it)
4. Colorize 00z steps in the grid
5. Options page to turn features on/off
